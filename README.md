# Team-024
The code repository for DataViz team 024. The project focuses on a dataset of 54 million tweets relating to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The goal of our project is to visually display how the sentiment and emotion of tweets about this conflict changes over time and in different countries, as well as, showing how exogenous events can rapidly change this sentiment.

## Database Info

### Table Names
raw_tweets - contains the original tweet data in database form

id_text - Just the id and text of the tweet (eventually will have the sentiment and emotion added)
